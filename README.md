SolarSystem
===========

An application that creates a solar system consisting of one or several suns, several planets and sattelites. The Solar system is stored in a SQL RDB. Future tests involve packages such as XNA C# 2d support for visual experiences. 

Bottom line, it's a simulation of a solar system with natural laws of nature such as, gravity, speed, mass.. and even interference of 2 bodies?
